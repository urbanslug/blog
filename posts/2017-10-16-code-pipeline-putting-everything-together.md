title: Pipeline as Code - putting everything together

In this post we shall implement a continuous deployment pipeline using
[ansible], [travis ci] and [git].

During implementation we don't have steps such as planning, provisioning,
configuration management etc that we mentioned in the [previous post]; those are
conceptual. The flowchart below represents the actual places that our software
should live at all times. Think of each component in the flowchart as a tool
that exposes an API with everything else abstracted away.

## Git (Version Control)
We want to have playbooks, deploy scripts and the actual application repo in
version control.

What we get from version control that is necessary for continuous deployment is:

 - tags get deployed to the main production environment
 - master branch gets deployed to the main staging environment
 - other major branches get deployed to other staging environments of your
 choosing

Not all these steps need to be done for it to be a continuous deployment
pipeline. For example: for this blog, changes that get merged into master go
straight into production. This is because the application is really small and
simple so before anything goes into master I know it's error free.
Moreover, even if the blog were to experience downtime I have very little to
lose compared to a business. This is the same model that github pages when uses
what is in master is pushed into the gh-pages branch which is basically a
gh pages blog's production environment.

## Ansible (Provisioning and Configuration Management)
Assuming you have a fresh server such as the one Digital Ocean would offer
or a fresh EC2 instance. We want an ansible play that creates an unprivileged
user with SSH authentication.
So we have to:

 - generate an SSH key pair without a passphrase locally
 - add the public key of that key to the deploy user's known_hosts file
 - push the private key to travis ci so that it can autheniticate as that user.

#### Generate an SSH keypair
Locally generate an SSH key that has **no passphrase** for the travis user and
add the public key to the deploy user's known_hosts
```
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "travis@travis-ci.org"
```
Under "Enter file in which to save the key..." enter `travis-ci`
This will create two files `travis-ci` and `travis-ci.pub`.

#### Add the public key to the deploy user's known_hosts
Write a play to prepare the deploy environment.

Copy the contents of `travis-ci.pub` file to the playbooks so that it's added to
that user's known_hosts every time.
For example [here's my public key in my playbooks](https://github.com/urbanslug/playbooks/blob/master/roles/base/vars/vars.yml#L1)

Here's a vars file
```yml
travis_ci_pubkey: "ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAINFzeaPrMXDVS1/+V4hKsgC+Pzoa9tnGGP+VCPT21QXP travis@travis-ci.org"
```

and here's the play that creates the user and adds the key
```yml
- include_vars: vars.yml

- name: Create deploy user
  user: name=deploy
        group=www

- name: copy travis-ci public ssh key to deploy user
  authorized_key: key="{{ travis_ci_pubkey }}"
        path=/home/deploy/.ssh/authorized_keys
  user=deploy
```

This creates the deploy user and adds the travis-ci.pub
to the deploy user's `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

In the case of this blog I run the below command from my devops server.
```bash
$ ansible-playbook base.yml --ask-sudo-pass --ask-vault-pass
```


#### Push the private key to travis ci
Install the [travis cli tool](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/encryption-keys/#Usage)
```bash
$ gem install travis
```

Encrypt your private key and add the decryption command to your .travis.yml file
using the travis cli tool and also push your public key to travis-ci with:
```bash
$ travis encrypt-file travis-ci --add
```

The `--add` flag  should add a  `before_install` phase to your .travis.yml file
that resembles the following:
```yml
 - openssl aes-256-cbc -K $encrypted_7f9f7befb56d_key -iv $encrypted_7f9f7befb56d_iv -in travis-ci.enc -out travis-ci -d
```
That line decrypts your travis-ci private key in the travis container at runtime
and creates a `~/travis-ci` which is the private key.

## Travis CI (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment)
Travis CI is a mix of open source and some propertary tools.
To quote them "Travis CI is run as a hosted service, free for Open Source, a
paid product for private code, and itâ€™s available as an on-premises version
(Travis CI Enterprise)."
Their [github page](https://github.com/travis-ci) and
[info page](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci).
To learn how to get started with travis in your project you can read
[get started doc](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/).
Moving on, I assume you have (gained) enough experience with travis to go on.

Travis will run tests and/or build our application on every branch or
specific branches based on rules that we set. We then build on this
functionality to deploy to a target based on various
rules. The obvious one being when our tests pass.

In our case: we want to run tests then after that deploy to the relevant target.
In your .travis.yml file you can use one of the following
[travis ci build phases] `after_success` or `deploy` steps.
I prefer to use `after_success` when I want to run a deploy scipt and `deploy`
for already supported deploy environments because the script feature is
experimental at the time of writing this.

> Exposes: .travis.yml

### Deploying to a host
We want to have push code from our travis container to our server.

#### Digital ocean/script using after_success
The `branches` section is essential in this case because it ensures that this
.travis.yml file is only ran on the master branch.
```yaml
branches:
  only:
    - master

after_success:
  - eval "$(ssh-agent -s)" #start the ssh agent
  - chmod 600 travis-ci
  - ssh-add  travis-ci # add travis-ci priv key to the ssh agent
  - cd _site
  - git init
  - git config --global user.email "$GIT_EMAIL"
  - git config --global user.name  "$GIT_NAME"
  - git remote add deploy "deploy@git.urbanslug.com:blog.git"
  - git add --all
  - git status
  - git commit -m "Built by Travis ( build $TRAVIS_BUILD_NUMBER )"
  - git push -q --force deploy master:master
```

#### Github pages
```yaml
deploy:
  skip_cleanup: true
  provider: pages
  local_dir: out
  github_token: $GH_TOKEN
  on:
    tags: true
```


#### AWS ECS
```yaml
deploy:
  # deploy to staging environment
  skip_cleanup: true
  provider: script
  ECS_CLUSTER_MASTER: app-staging
  ECS_SERVICE_MASTER: app-staging
  script:
    - yarn run travis-ecs-deploy
  on:
    branch: master

  # deploy to production environment
  skip_cleanup: true
  provider: script
  ECS_CLUSTER_MASTER: app-production
  ECS_SERVICE_MASTER: app-production
  script:
    - yarn run travis-ecs-deploy
  on:
    tags: true
```

With this initial setup, we should have the CI tool handle all deploys going
forward. If anything goes wrong we can go into the devops server and then run
the ansible script and have it deploy a specific tag/branch.
