Hey guys I had quite a big issue figuring out how to package a python project.
I am going to use Python 3.

As an example projects I came up with [Arithmetic].
The point of arithmetic is to show how to structure tests (which testing framework might be good).  
How to structure the code. How to package it for distribution via a tool like pip or pypy and so forth.
