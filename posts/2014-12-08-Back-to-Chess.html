<p>This is not a post about any chess strategies but about me playing chess again after a not playing for a while. This post makes me wish my blog had comments. You could tweet me at <span class="citation">[@urbanslug]</span> if it’s not too much work.</p>
<p>So after many years of not playing chess, at least taking it seriously, I’ve decided to go back to playing. Why? I thought it would help me with mathematics and logic and programming but it’s turned out to be a lot of fun so now I’m doing it because it’s fun.</p>
<p>So it’s like this, I’m getting better at my opening game thanks to <a href="http://mychessblog.com">mychessblog.com</a>. My middle game and end game will be worked on in that order. I’m not reading any books yet because I have exams to study for but I am reading a lot of online material other than what I’ve mentioned above and playing a lot more. I will start on a book when I get the time hopefully this December. I will write a review on the book that I will read and how it has impacted my playing.</p>
<p>Also I have tried creating a profile on <a href="http://www.freechess.org/Register/index.html">FICS</a> (Free Internet Chess Server) to play online, for some reason they never send me the confirmation email. I guess I’ll be playing as guest until I get the time to email an admin and whine. Why I chose <a href="http://www.freechess.org/Register/index.html">FICS</a>? I installed pychess (on my arch) and the online play it has allows for <a href="http://www.freechess.org/Register/index.html">FICS</a> as the default so I went with it.</p>
<p>I hope this will be as fun as I remember it being back when I was in chess club and there was a coach and not just be a phase. Anyway if <a href="http://mychessblog.com">mychessblog.com</a> has taught me anything it’s that it’s not about reading books or memorizing strategies but rather about practice.</p>
