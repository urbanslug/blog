title: About
---

I'm a programmer who prefers to write code using: pure functions, immutable data structures and type systems with type inference.
I really love it when systems I build are reliable and currently lean towards tools such as nix, Kubernetes and docker.

Other fun things I've gotten into include: logic, philosophy and psychology.

Topics I write about include but are not limited to:

- Computer science
- Linux
- Software architechture
- Software enginnering
- Programming
- Cryptography
- Personal development
- The development of Africa
