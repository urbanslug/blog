<p>Graphic novel on the history of and a gentle intro to some of the biggest ideas in logic, math and modern philosophy. It’s really not a comic and it’s a great read.</p>
<p>It’s a lot of things in one: - A story about the conflict between ideal rationality and the unchanging flawed fabric of reality. - A tragedy with logicians as heroes</p>

<h1 id="plot">Plot</h1>
<p>Autobiography of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand Russell</a></strong> as a comic book.</p>
<p>It’s not entirely factual because it is meant to both captivate the reader but also show the kind of thought process and lives the founders of logic had because the writers feel this is vital to understanding their ideas (I feel the same way).</p>
<p>Starts Sept 1939 when Germany invaded Poland, (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzkrieg">Blitzkrieg</a>). Countdown to another world war beings UK had signed a pact of non aggression with Hitler</p>
<p>Sept 4 1939 Bertand Russel was meant to give a lecture on <strong>the role of logic in human affairs</strong> at an American uni.</p>
<p>Sept 4 1939 UK declared war on Germany</p>
<p>USA had <em>isolationists</em> who wanted the USA not to join the war</p>
<p>Russel had an elder brother who went to bording school but was cut from the comic.</p>
<h2 id="pembroke-lodge">1. Pembroke Lodge</h2>
<p>His uncle was the source of the howls. He was mad and madness was Bertand’s greatest fear because it meant being the furthest from logic as a person can be. He would’ve ended his life then had it not been for the hope of <strong>reason</strong>. Were it not for math. He says so in greek exercises (a diary he kept to keep his grandmother from snooping).</p>
<h2 id="sorcerers-apprentice">2. Sorcerer’s apprentice</h2>
<p>Met the girl who was to be his wife got first class hons at Cambridge</p>
<p>The atoms of logic are propositions which we combine thorugh certain laws</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_ratiocinator">calculus ratiocinator</a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz">Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz</a> was a framework of logic Leibniz used this formal symbolic language to say such things as: a tautology added to itself is a tautology</p>
<p>Leibniz taught Moore about logic. Logic is using combinations of the known to reach the unknown</p>
<h2 id="wanderjahre">3. Wanderjahre</h2>
<p>Bertrand went to Paris because he learned that since math rests on arithmetic they must first make arithmetic solid</p>
<h2 id="paradoxes">4. Paradoxes</h2>
<p>After returning from Paris Bertrand wanted to write a book that would solve all foundational problems this was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Principles_of_Mathematics">The Principles of Mathematics</a> published 1903. He was to use a notation invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Peano">Giuseppe Peano</a></p>
<p>We then run into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell's_paradox">Russell’s paradox</a></p>
<p>When something refers to itself a paradox is nearby.</p>
<p><em>A set can contain other sets or even itself. A set of all ideas is an idea. Therefore it contains itself as an element. Does the set of all sets which do not contain themselves contain itself? This subverts the notion of set as a collection defined by a common property</em></p>
<p>This failure in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory">set theory</a> led to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">type theory</a>. The foundations of math were like a mythical turtle supporting the cosmos yet all they did trying to create a solid ground for it was create a tower of turtles all the way down.</p>
<p>Set theory then felt like a foundation of systems without a foundation. See also this section on Wikipedia entry: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory#Objections_to_set_theory_as_a_foundation_for_mathematics">Objections to set theory as a foundation for mathematics</a>.</p>
<h2 id="entracte">5. Entracte</h2>
<p>Map makers, insanity and logic.</p>
<p>Logic is a map trying to map out reality. In the end they (logicians) ended up confusing reality with their maps</p>
<h2 id="logico-philosophical-wars">6. Logico-philosophical wars</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottlob_Frege">Gottlob Frege</a> sends <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a> to Russel. They really get into types</p>
<p>According to Wittgenstein, Language is a model of reality.</p>
<p>Bertrand Russel wrote philosophy of math in prison for protesting USA’s involvement in the war for which he got 6 months in prison. His appetite for moral duty had been satisfied. Wittgenstein wrote his total solution to problems of philosophy on the eastern front this was the <a href="http://www.tractatuslogico-philosophicus.com/">Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</a> (TLP) published in 1922. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._E._Moore">G. E. Moore</a> really liked it. Bertrand Russel didn’t. I haven’t yet read it to give an opinion on it.</p>
<h2 id="incompleteness">6. Incompleteness</h2>
<p>Some proofs can’t be proven according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del">Kurt Gödel</a>.</p>
<h2 id="finale">7. Finale</h2>
<p>I don’t have much to say here.</p>
<h1 id="ideas">Ideas</h1>
<p>Reason is in its highest form, logic.</p>
<p>High rate of psychosis amongst founders of logic.</p>
<p>Bertrand Russel’s grandfather was former prime minister of great Britain but not of Pembroke lodge.</p>
<p>Logic is all about rules. Begins with definitions and continues with rules.</p>
<p>euclid’s proposition</p>
<p>Plato’s symposium is where he wrote about <em>finding your other half</em> interesting stuff btw</p>
<p>euclid</p>
<p>What is a number but the set of all sets with that number elements in it? e.g what is 3 but the set of all sets with 3 elements?</p>
<p>A set can contain other sets or even itself. A set of all ideas is an idea. Therefore it contains itself as an element.</p>
<p>The set of all birds is not a set.</p>
<p>Independent existence of a mathematical reality. We don’t make it up but it exists. Is there an objective reality?</p>
<p>Wittgenstein ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sleep of reason produces monsters.</li>
<li>Language is a corruption of pure thought.</li>
</ul>
<p>Vienna circle’s rationalistic world view has desecrated hallowed Germanic values and for that Schlick was killed by Hitler.</p>

<p><strong>tautology:</strong> a statement that is true by virtue of its logical form e.g all red ants are red.</p>
<p><strong>logic:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>to Aristotle: logic is new and necessary reasoning.</li>
<li>new because you learn what you don’t know.</li>
<li>necessary because conclusions are inescapble</li>
<li>e.g all men are mortal. socrates is a man therefore socrates is mortal. new and necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>Leibniz turned this into a symbolic system … and Boole</p>
<p>The international congress the world’s greatest rendezvous of mathematicians</p>
<p>Types save us from paradox they are essential to logic</p>
<p>propositional calculus invented by Leibniz is borrowed a lot from Boole’s work</p>
<p><strong>Anscluss:</strong> Annexation of Austria by nazi Germany</p>

<p>Developed the idea that logical propositions can be expressed in purely symbolic lang which allows them to be manipulated by operations similar to arithmetic Worked wholly with aristotle’s method.

<h4 id="gottlob-frege">Gottlob Frege</h4>
<p>Wrote the <strong>concept script</strong> The point of logic is not calculation but to <strong>model</strong> reality. Ordinary language is not suited to science. A language that is completely logical, only such a language can deal with the foundations of mathematics.
